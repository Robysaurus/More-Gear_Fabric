This mod adds 15 new sets of armor of tools! 4 of these sets are based off of vanilla items while the rest are based off of new materials that have also been added, some of which are found in new geodes! There is also a new boss in the game: the Shrike which can be found in a custom structure throughout the end! Also, with upgrade templates scattered across many different structures you'll explore your world! There are also two _secret_ items so to say. If you want to know about them then reveal the spoilers below and if you want to discover them on your own, well you might need to kill quite a few Shrikes and perhaps the Ender Dragon a couple of times as well. ðŸ˜‰

There is also a spoiler below for the locations of all upgrade templates if you want to know. :D

### _Secret_ Item 1
<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>

The first _secret_ item is a dagger with an obfuscated name. It's pretty simple. It OHKOs everything... like everything everything. To get it, you'll need to scour the end for Shrikes and slaughter them because this weapon has but a 1% chance of dropping from a Shrike. It should be noted that this dagger also has infinite durability (it doesn't take any durability damage whatsoever) because why not.

### _Secret_ Item 2

<summary>Spoiler</summary>

The second _secret_ item is an elytra-chestplate. The catch however is that an elytra can only be combined with the highest tier chestplate so you'll have to progress pretty far in the game before you can aquire one. Also, the worn model just looks like the normal chestplate and the elytra wings part are completely invisible because then when you fly around it looks like you are mimicking Superman's flight and I thought it was funny.
